# Youtube Search App

This is an application I created while following Stephen Grider's [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux) course.

### What does it do?

This application allows users to search the youtube API for videos. It shows video thumbnails, video metadata, and allows users to play videos through an iframe.
